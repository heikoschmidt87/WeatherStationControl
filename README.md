WeatherStationControl
=====================

This project's goal is to implement a functional weather station that measures the following environmental parameters:

- wind speed
- wind direction
- temperature
- amount of rain/snow
- atmospheric pressure

The values will be transmitted via an RFM12 module to different devices. This devices may be the topic for other projects as well.

The station will be powered by battery. It's planned to create the additional power sources:

- solar power
- wind power

For future use, a solar tracking system is planned to be implemented.
